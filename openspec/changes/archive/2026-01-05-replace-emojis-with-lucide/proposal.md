# Replace Emojis with Lucide Icons

## Problem
The application currently uses emojis for icons, which results in inconsistent rendering across devices and a less professional aesthetic.

## Solution
Install `lucide-react` and replace all instances of emojis used as UI icons with appropriate Lucide icons.
